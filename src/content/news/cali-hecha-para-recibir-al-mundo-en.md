# Cali, a city made to welcome the world, will host JamCam 2025

With experience, joy, and vibrant energy, the capital of Valle del Cauca is preparing to host JamCam 2025—proving why it's one of the most attractive destinations for international gatherings.

In the heart of southwestern Colombia lies a city that not only moves to the rhythm of salsa but has also mastered the language of major events. Cali is a festive, multicultural city that will welcome thousands of young Scouts from across the Americas in December 2025 for the much-anticipated JamCam, one of the most significant gatherings in the global Scouting movement.

## Why is Cali the ideal host for JamCam 2025?

Its recent track record as a host city for international events says it all. Cali has learned to welcome the world with character, professionalism—and a warmth that few other destinations can offer.

## What international events has Cali hosted?

In recent years, Cali has established itself as a premier destination for visitors from all over the globe. In 2024, it hosted the COP16 for Biodiversity, one of the most important events on the global environmental calendar. Over nearly two weeks, more than 12,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries walked its streets, stayed in its hotels, dined in its restaurants, visited its fairs, and left with an unforgettable impression of the city.

The logistics were impeccable. The Blue Zone, designated for official negotiations, brought together government leaders, scientists, entrepreneurs, and Indigenous communities. Meanwhile, the Green Zone, open to the public, buzzed with concerts, artistic showcases, gastronomy, and biodiversity experiences. Cali proved not only that it could organize such an event—but that it could welcome the world with open arms.

In 2023, the city hosted the CONMEBOL Women's Libertadores, attracting more than 5,600 visitors, including 3,700 international tourists. That year, sports passion fused with local pride—hotels reported record occupancy, tourists discovered a vibrant city, and teams experienced the hospitality of Cali's people at every turn.

Other large-scale events followed, such as the XII Summit of the Pacific Alliance, the International Health Tourism Forum, and the upcoming Colombia Nature Travel Mart (2025), which will bring dozens of international buyers focused on eco-tourism.

Cali also hosted Macrorrueda "Colombia, the Country of Beauty", a business platform connecting local entrepreneurs with global buyers. These events do more than boost the economy—they highlight the aesthetic, cultural, and human richness of Colombia… all proudly embodied in Cali.

## A city with soul and meaning

Beyond its logistics and infrastructure, Cali offers something more powerful: its transformational spirit. Initiatives like "Weavers of Peace and Civic Culture" and "Peace with Our Own Voice" have helped build a narrative where visitors are not just spectators but active participants in a city seeking healing, growth, and connection. Every activity, every conversation, every workshop and artistic intervention becomes a space not just of beauty, but of meaning.

## What makes Cali special for visitors?

First and foremost: its people. Caleños have a unique ability to make anyone feel at home. Their kindness and joyful spirit are hard to describe—and even harder to forget. Whether you come from southern Argentina or northern Canada, you'll always be welcome here.

Next: its infrastructure. The city has an international airport connected to key destinations across the continent, a growing hotel network, and numerous venues for outdoor and cultural events. One of them is Comfandi Pance, a recreational center surrounded by nature in southern Cali. With expansive green areas, ecological trails, and ideal camping spaces, it offers the perfect balance between comfort and outdoor adventure. Nestled at the foot of the Farallones mountains, it promises scouts a safe, inspiring experience in full harmony with the natural world.

And of course: its culture. Cali breathes salsa, but also fusion cuisine, urban art, theater, literature, and a rich Afro-Colombian and Indigenous heritage. Visitors can dance at a salsoteca, sip a traditional champús in San Antonio, or explore independent galleries. Here, every experience becomes a story worth telling.

## Is Cali ready for JamCam 2025?

Absolutely. JamCam 2025 will bring together thousands of Scouts from across the Americas in a celebration of adventure, learning, service, and diversity. The days will be filled with outdoor living, cultural exchange, and the core values of Scouting. With its warm climate, privileged geography, and welcoming culture, Cali is the perfect stage for this event.

The city is already preparing to ensure Scouts enjoy a safe, well-organized, and deeply meaningful experience. From transportation and health services to food and entertainment, every detail is being carefully planned so that international visitors will find in Cali not just a host city—but a temporary home full of magic.

Delegates of the COP have lived it. Athletes from Latin America have lived it. Health tourism entrepreneurs and heads of state have lived it.

Now, it's the Scouts' turn.

JamCam 2025 is coming—and Cali has already opened its heart.
