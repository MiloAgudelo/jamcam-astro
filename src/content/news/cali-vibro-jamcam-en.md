# Cali vibrated with Interamerican JamCam 2025: Americas united for peace

Thousands of scouts and walkers from across the continent gathered in Cali to live an unforgettable experience of culture, service, adventure, and brotherhood.

The Interamerican JamCam 2025 turned the capital of Valle del Cauca into the youth heart of the Americas.

From December 27, 2025 to January 2, 2026, Cali, Colombia, was the meeting point for young people from more than 20 countries, who participated in the Interamerican JamCam 2025, a camp that integrated adventure, cultural exchange, and values education under the motto "Americas United for Peace".

The main venue was the Comfandi Pance Camp Center, accompanied by spaces in the city that allowed participants to learn about the history, culture, and spirit of Cali. The JamCam brought together the best of the jamboree and camporee in the same setting, consolidating itself as one of the most important scout events on the continent.

## How were the ceremonies and most emblematic moments of JamCam 2025 experienced?

The opening ceremony on December 27 marked the beginning of a week full of emotion, music, and symbols. The flag parade, the presentation of the official anthem, cultural acts, and Colombian artistic expressions welcomed thousands of young people who, from that first moment, began to build bonds of brotherhood.

One of the most memorable moments was the New Year celebration, in which all delegations shared a great intercultural party to welcome 2026, reinforcing the message of unity, hope, and peaceful coexistence.

## What activities made JamCam a unique cultural and educational experience?

The program offered a diverse agenda that integrated adventure, exploration, learning, and creativity. The Interamerican Village and country stands became meeting points where participants shared gastronomy, dances, music, and traditions from every corner of the continent.

Salsa classes, artistic workshops, adventure circuits, sports challenges, and tours of Cali allowed participants to experience local culture and strengthen skills such as leadership, teamwork, and empathy. Everything was connected to the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting a vision of active and responsible citizenship.

## How was the motto "Americas United for Peace" put into practice?

Peace was lived in every greeting, in every exchange, and in every project. JamCam 2025 included community service activities, reflection spaces, and collaborative dynamics where young people worked together, beyond borders, languages, or cultures.

The motto was reflected in daily coexistence, in respect for diversity, and in the construction of friendships that transcended the camp. Participants, volunteers from the International Service Team, and special guests agreed that Cali was the perfect setting to demonstrate that brotherhood is a real tool to transform the world.

The Interamerican JamCam 2025 left a legacy of learning, joy, and commitment. Cali was not only the venue for a camp, but the temporary home of a generation that chose to meet, listen, and build a future where peace is lived in concrete actions.
