# Day 2 of JamCam 2025 in Cali, Colombia: how activities and cultural connections were experienced

The participants of JamCam Inter-American 2025 are already in Cali enjoying its warmth and all the activities that the staff has prepared for them.

After the great opening ceremony that took place on the evening of Saturday, December 27, activities began on Sunday, December 28 in the Subcamps of the event, and the boys and girls, from both the Jamboree and Camporee, have been enjoying all kinds of activities.

## What activities could be enjoyed on the second day of JamCam 2025 in Cali?

One of the dynamics that the JamCam 2025 staff has prepared for boys and girls has to do with a structure located at Comfandi Pance, where the camp takes place, which allows young people not only to exercise, but also to test their balance.

It is an obstacle course in the air that they must cross, with all safety measures, with physical agility and testing the tension that can be felt at heights.

Another group of participants had their outing both to tour Cali and get to know the most representative places of this beautiful Colombian city, as well as to contribute to service activities that are planned with different foundations.

## How were inter-American cultural connections experienced at JamCam 2025?

Since this day 2 of JamCam 2025, youth participants have been able to share in the Inter-American Village and with the stands of each of the countries. In the Village, they have been able to work on different activities around the event's motto 'Americas united for peace' and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN.

These are activities in which not only topics that help build a better world are discussed, but also reinforce values such as teamwork, leadership and creativity.

On the other hand, the exchange of cultures and customs is taking place in the stands that each of the contingents set up with elements from their own country. On this day we saw, for example, many of these countries presenting their gastronomy through images and even offering samples such as sweets or coffee.

The JamCam participants and the International Service Team (IST) have been excited about these activities that increase their knowledge about the cultural diversity that exists in the Americas and encourages them to identify with the values they share.
