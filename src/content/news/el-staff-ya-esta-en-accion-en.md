# JamCam 2025 Cali is underway! The staff is already in action

Adult volunteers are "always ready to serve," shaping JamCam 2025 at Comfandi Pance in Cali with commitment and fraternity.

On December 25, from early morning hours, all the volunteers of the Scout Movement arrived, joining JamCam 2025 in Cali, Colombia, with commitment, generosity, and selflessness to make this event an unforgettable experience for thousands of young participants.

## What did the volunteers experience on their first day of preparation for JamCam 2025?

These volunteers not only arrived to meet their teammates, bond, and begin the work of transforming Comfandi Pance into a unique space for JamCam, but also to carry out a site walkthrough of the areas where activities will take place.

Volunteers who are part of the official JamCam 2025 staff also received the items that will identify them as team members and make it easier for young participants to recognize them.

## What message did Scout leaders share to motivate the JamCam 2025 staff?

Additionally, with the guidance of the Head of Camp, Johnson Cansario, the official event anthem was presented. It aims to reflect the rhythms and melodies of our region, as well as the values the camp seeks to promote: peace, unity, and fraternity.

Alejandro Martínez, National Scout President, also welcomed the staff volunteers and explained the importance of holding a camp of this magnitude in one of Colombia's most biodiverse and joyful capitals: Cali. He invited everyone to live out each of the values together with their teammates.

Each volunteer identified their work team and organized all their tools. In this way, when the children, adolescents, and young participants arrive at Comfandi Pance to enjoy an unforgettable Scout experience, every volunteer will be ready to make it happen.
