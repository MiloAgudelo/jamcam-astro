# JamCam 2025 Cali welcomes the adult volunteer team!

JamCam 2025 Cali receives the International Service Team, made up of international adult volunteers who will strengthen the camp organization and enrich the experience of participating children and youth.

Following the arrival of the JamCam 2025 staff at Comfandi Pance to organize the site and moments of the event that will bring together more than 2,000 children and young participants; it is now time for the International Service Team (IST), who arrived from Friday morning, December 16, from all over the American continent.

## What expectations does the International Service Team have about the event?

These adult volunteers arrive seeking a unique experience and a different perspective on how to experience JamCam in Cali, Colombia. It is a challenge to their skills and the generosity with which they work to make this event a dream come true.

## What experiences and activities will the International Service Team have at JamCam 2025 Cali?

The International Service Team not only arrives as volunteers to ensure children have a great experience, but the JamCam organizing team has also prepared a program of activities for them through which they will be enriched by cultural exchange and can test their skills, in addition to a tour of Cali where they will discover the beauty and charm of this city.

We had the opportunity to speak with an adult volunteer participant of the International Service Team, Thomas Bernal, who said "My expectations are to learn, grow as a leader and better develop myself in the Scout Movement right now"

Thus, the IST adults also have many expectations about what they will experience at this camp, the people they will connect with and all the places they will discover, as well as the delicious gastronomy of Valle, the biodiversity that characterizes Colombia so much, and the joyful customs with which they will surely encounter.
