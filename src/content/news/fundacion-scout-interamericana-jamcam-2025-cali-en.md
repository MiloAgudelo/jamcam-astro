# Scout Foundation of the Americas is at JamCam 2025 in Cali: We interviewed its executive director

Pratik Vaidya and Juan Manuel 'Pollo' Salvado, president and executive director of the Scout Foundation of the Americas respectively, are present at JamCam Inter-American 2025 in Cali, Colombia. Learn about their perspective on the event.

The gathering of scouts and walkers from all the Americas in Cali, Colombia is already underway: JamCam Inter-American 2025, and it has very special guests such as the Scout Foundation of the Americas, who not only attended the opening ceremony, but also activities such as those taking place in the Inter-American Village and the stands of each of the contingents.

We interviewed Juan Manuel 'Pollo' Salvado, executive director of the foundation, who was accompanied by the president of the organization, Pratik Vaidya, while enjoying the Ecuadorian culture displayed at their stand.

## What did the Executive Director of the Scout Foundation of the Americas say about JamCam 2025?

**Q:** How did you experience the opening ceremony of JamCam 2025 in Cali?

**JMPS:** Very excited. The first thing that comes to me is excitement, the second: party and happiness, as one of the party presenters said yesterday. Everything seemed very magical to me.

**Q:** What are the values that you believe JamCam 2025 will instill in participants?

**JMPS:** I think the first value is peace, fraternity. I believe that fraternity among young people is what these regional events really bring, this coexistence between regions, between countries, between different cultures: I think it is the main value we have to take away from here.

**Q:** What is the most rewarding thing about witnessing an international event like this?

**JMPS:** That all events are different, so it is very gratifying for me to know that none is the same as the previous one we experienced.

**Q:** What is the differential you find in this one?

**JMPS:** I think there is a special energy as a result of the years that a JamCam has not been held and I think there was a lot of desire post-pandemic to experience an event like this and I think the sun, the weather, Colombian fraternity, everything is like the perfect place for this to happen.
