# JamCam 2025 in Cali, Colombia launches its official anthem and several more songs on YouTube

With the traditional rhythms and melodies of Colombian cumbia, JamCam 2025 presents its anthem and invites everyone not only to sing it, but also to dance and clap along.

In addition, the team of this important scout event presented 9 other songs that represent what this great gathering of American scout brothers and sisters is all about.

## What inspired the JamCam Interamerican 2025 anthem?

The anthem, cheerful and catchy, is an invitation to sing together around Colombian biodiversity, the joy of our region, and peace and service, which are values promoted in each of the camp activities.

But not only the lyrics embrace the values that unite us as scouts, but also the rhythm and melody, as the anthem is a Colombian cumbia that increases the energy of those who listen to it and encourages them to dance and share with those who have the same passion: scouting.

In addition to the anthem, JamCam 2025 gave its attendees an even bigger musical gift: nine more songs ideal for each of the moments and activities of the event, including sharing with friends.

The songs are very varied, as they have rhythms and melodies of all kinds such as rock, pop and more cumbias. As for the lyrics, the themes are also diverse: scout nights, the lifestyle of service, love for singing or the stages experienced in scouting.
