# JamCam: a history uniting the Americas since 1965

Cali, Colombia – Our story began in 1965, when Scouts from across the continent gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the first Pan-American Jamboree (JamPan). That event marked the beginning of a legacy of friendship, service, and brotherhood that has traveled throughout the Americas, strengthening unity and the Scout spirit for decades.

## How was the Interamerican Camp we now call JamCam born?

For many years, JamPan was the most anticipated gathering of the Scout Movement in the region, hosted by countries such as Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Jamaica, Guatemala, and Peru. Each edition left an unforgettable mark on participants, fostering leadership, teamwork, and the commitment to leave the world a better place.

## Why is JamCam 2025 the evolution of the Scout legacy in the Interamericas?

In 2013, JamPan evolved into the Interamerican Scout Jamboree-Camporee (JamCam), merging the adventurous spirit of the Jamboree with the close-knit experience of the Camporee. Since then, Ecuador, Mexico, and now Colombia have welcomed us as hosts.
