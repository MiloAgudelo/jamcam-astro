# This is how the inauguration of JamCam Interamerican 2025 Cali was experienced!

Come see what happened on this highly anticipated night at JamCam 2025 at Comfandi Pance Cali

Since the morning of December 27, the technical production teams of JamCam 2025 Cali finalized the last tests to ensure our grand opening was an incredible experience for all the young people, leaders, and IST members.

During the first night, we had a parade of the nations present with two representatives from each one and their flags. Additionally, the event's anthem was presented to the participants, there was a performance by the Colombian National Police band, and many emotional moments and exclusive presentations that made our night much more special and unique. It will be engraved in the memory and hearts of all participants.
