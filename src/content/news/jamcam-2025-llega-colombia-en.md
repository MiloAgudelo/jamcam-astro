# JamCam 2025 arrives in Colombia: Americas united for peace

Cali, Colombia – From December 27, 2025 to January 2, 2026, Cali will be the stage for the Interamerican Scout Jamboree-Camporee (JamCam), the most important gathering of the Scout Movement in the Americas region. Under the motto "Americas United for Peace", more than 2,500 young people aged 11 to 17 and adult volunteers from more than 30 countries will come together to experience a transformative journey of cultural exchange, learning, and community service.

## Why will JamCam 2025 be the most anticipated interamerican camp?

Since its first edition, JamCam has become a space where borders disappear, cultures embrace each other, and diversity is celebrated. Colombia has been our home on three previous occasions: La Calera in 1974, Bogotá in 1990, and Mosquera in 2013. In 2025, we return to continue building peace through adventure, leadership, and friendship.

## What makes JamCam Cali unique in the interamericas region?

The Centro Campestre Comfandi Pance, in the heart of Valle del Cauca, will be our base camp, a perfect place for thousands of Scouts to strengthen bonds, develop life skills, and live the values of inclusion, sustainability, and cooperation.

## How will JamCam 2025 transform lives in Colombia?

Over seven days, we will offer activities in adventure, culture, arts, sports, community service, and projects focused on the Sustainable Development Goals. All in a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment, following the global Safe from Harm policy.

JamCam 2025 will be much more than a camp: it will be a living movement that will leave a mark on every participant and the communities we touch.
