# More activities at JamCam 2025 Cali, discover a new day!

JamCam 2025 Cali participants enjoy the camp by doing extreme games, recreational workshops and city tours.

On a new day of camp, the boys and girls of the Camporee took advantage of the Comfandi Pance facilities to have fun with the climbing wall, the zip-line over the lake and the hanging ropes circuit that the complex has.

Likewise, Jamboree participants traveled to Cali to tour the city and visit different tourist sites, the young people visited the Zoo, passed through the Historic Center and saw a bit of the Cali Fair that is celebrated this week. On these outings, JamCam 2025 Cali participants learn about historical milestones of Colombia, its culture and the customs of this department.

JamCam 2025 Cali, in turn, has been an opportunity for participants from the Colombia contingent to get to know the Valle del Cauca region. This event manages to concentrate and contextualize host participants about their own culture, its symbols and its richness in the country's diversity.

Under the motto "United Americas for Peace", JamCam 2025 Cali directs its activities towards promoting coexistence, respect and brotherhood among the invited countries. This thematic axis reinforces scout values and highlights the role of young people as agents of peace, capable of building bonds of cooperation and understanding from cultural diversity.
