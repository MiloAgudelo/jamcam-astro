# Why is Colombia the ideal host for JamCam 2025?

Folklore, culture, and the warmth of the Colombian people will be the heart of JamCam 2025, the scout event that will bring together thousands of young people from across the continent in Cali from December 27, 2025, to January 1, 2026.

## What makes Colombia a unique host for JamCam 2025?

During a recent official visit to the city, delegation leaders from various countries got a firsthand look at the venue for this great adventure: Centro Campestre Comfandi Pance. There, Javier Martínez, Head of the Colombian Delegation, highlighted that Cali's greatest asset as host is its cultural authenticity and vibrant joy—elements that will make this event truly unforgettable.

"We're going to show you folklore, we're going to show you culture, we're going to show you that Colombian warmth you can only find in this land. And let me ask you: how many times have you rung in the New Year with over 2,000 scouts from our region?" said Martínez.

## What is the essence of JamCam 2025 in Cali?

JamCam 2025 will combine the 17th Interamerican Jamboree and the 4th Interamerican Scout Camporee, under the theme "Americas United for Peace." Scouts aged 11 to 17, adult leaders, and International Service Team (IST) volunteers will enjoy days filled with sports, cultural exchanges, art, and community service, along with an Interamerican Village inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

But beyond the program, the true highlight will be the spirit of friendship, unity, and celebration. With evening shows, a special New Year's celebration, and Cali's warm hospitality, this event promises to be more than just a camp—it will be a continent-wide festival full of meaning.

If you're a scout dreaming of an unforgettable experience, this is your moment. JamCam 2025 is waiting with open arms, the joy of Colombia, and thousands of new friends ready to share one promise: to build a better world together. See you in Cali!
