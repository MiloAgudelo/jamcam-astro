# José Luis Vargas, President of the Interamerican Scout Committee, visits the Interamerican Village at JamCam 2025

José Luis Vargas, President of the Interamerican Scout Committee, visited the stands of each of the countries participating in JamCam 2025 and interacted with several attendees.

The Interamerican JamCam 2025 in Cali, Colombia, with the motto 'Americas united for peace', began on Saturday, December 27, and not only are participants, scouts, and rovers enjoying what this cultural encounter and Cali's climate offer, but also very special guests like José Luis Vargas, President of the Interamerican Scout Committee.

## How has the President of the Interamerican Scout Committee participated in JamCam 2025?

José Luis was present at the event's opening ceremony, delivering important words about the meaning of this gathering and the importance of participants in building a better world. The next day, he surprised attendees by participating in activities at the contingent stands and the Interamerican Village.

José Luis was not only seen greeting the young people at the venue and observing the main elements that participating countries want to present to the rest of the Americas; he was even seen participating in activities like a salsa class with pure Cali style.

## What else did José Luis Vargas do at the Interamerican Village at JamCam 2025 in Cali?

Another moment that attendees witnessed with the President of the Interamerican Scout Committee was the encounter with a man who mentioned having been a scout, and José Luis's response was moving, as he reminded him that one never stops being a scout.

These interactions are a living example of what the scout spirit is: sharing, exchanging teachings, and enjoying unity. At JamCam 2025, that is the priority: building peace from the values of scouting. Let's look forward to everything that's coming for the following days of the interamerican camp.
