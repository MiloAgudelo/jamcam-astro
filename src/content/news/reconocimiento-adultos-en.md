## What is the importance of EIS, staffs and CMT in JamCam 2025 Cali?

The service team and adult volunteers are the foundation that supports the operation of a Scout camp like JamCam 2025. They are the ones who, often away from the spotlight, ensure organization, security, food, cleanliness, and logistics, allowing activities to happen smoothly and productively. Their commitment, spirit of service, and sense of responsibility create a safe and welcoming environment in which young people can learn, challenge themselves, and fully live the values of Scouting.

Beyond practical work, these volunteers play a fundamental educational role, being living examples of leadership, cooperation, and service to others. By dedicating time, energy, and experience, they inspire Scouts to develop autonomy, respect, and teamwork. Valuing the service team and adult volunteers means recognizing that, without their presence and dedication, the camp would not have the same formative impact nor the same spirit of unity that marks the best Scout experiences.
