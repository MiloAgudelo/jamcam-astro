# JamCam 2025 Cali Official Stand at the Inter-American Village! Check out the details

Don't miss this opportunity to make more inter-American connections, new friends and have a lot of fun

Scouting is based on brotherhood and unity among all. We always yearn to make friends and learn new things. Since the movement's creation, we have worked together in patrols, troops, packs and clans. In addition to camps with scouts from various places and cultures, where we further strengthen our friendships and encounters.

We have a universal symbol: the friendship knots, which we tie on our friends' scarves and symbolize the brotherhood among all scouts in the world. That's why, in this JamCam 2025 Cali, our official stand is open! Young people will be able to make friendship bracelets, paint their faces with their figures or animals, stick shiny stones, make friends, learn about other cultures and exchange badges, scarves and whatever they wish.

They can also take photos with Cholao's wings, the JamCam 2025 Cali mascot, with their friends and take this memory home. It's a stand where the priority is fraternity, unity and friendship among the Americas.

## Where is the JamCam 2025 stand and those of the other contingents located?

The official JamCam 2025 - Cali stand is next to the Brazil stand. The stands are located on the street in front of the 'House of the Americas', near the lake.

## How will the JamCam 2025 Cali stands work?

They are open in the morning and afternoon until the end of the event. Come see it and take advantage of this great opportunity.
